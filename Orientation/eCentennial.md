## eCentennial and Accessibility

> "Web accessibility refers to how easily people with disabilities can
> navigate and interact with websites. Disabilities may be physical
> (such as blindness, low vision, deafness, or fine motor skills
> difficulty), or cognitive (such as dyslexia or attention deficit
> disorder). People with disabilities often use assistive technologies
> to help them navigate the web. An assistive technology is any device
> that helps a person with a disability. Common web assistive
> technologies include modified mice and keyboards, screen readers and
> screen magnifiers.
>
> Web accessibility occurs when websites support web accessibility
> standards, are compatible with assistive technologies, and are easy
> for people to navigate and understand."
