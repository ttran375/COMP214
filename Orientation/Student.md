# Expectations and Responsibilities

## What I Expect of You as a Student

As a student, there are certain behaviours your professor and peers
expect you to follow. The following list covers the most important
expectations:

1.  Log into the class at least once a week.
2.  Complete all of the work listed in the weekly checklists.
3.  Take part in the discussion forums.
4.  Communicate with your peers and professor in a professional manner
    and adhere to the <a

5.  Contact your professor whenever you experience difficulties with the
    course.

    one week after the due date and will have a 25% penalty applied.
9.  All assignments are to be submitted via the Assignment tool (under
    the Assessments dropdown).
10. Tests and quizzes are to be completed alone, but students are
    otherwise free to use whatever resources are available so long as
    they do not fall into academic dishonesty.

## What You Should Expect of Me as your Professor

Just as there are are expectations placed on you, you can expect me to
fulfill my duties in a timely manner. Here is a list of what to expect
from me:

1.  I will treat all students with respect.
2.  I will respond to e-mails within 24 hours (including / excluding
    weekends).
3.  I will check the discussion forum and respond to posts three times a
    week.
4.  Every assignment will have written feedback and/or a filled out
    rubric.
5.  Assignments and tests will be marked within one week of the due
    date, or two weeks for the final assignment.

Please note that the best way to get in touch with me is by email. If
you have an urgent to discuss the course, email or coming to my office
hours are the quickest way to get in touch with me.
